**Booster Role**
You'll receive a role named @Server Booster while boosting the server.

**Special Role**
We don't normally give out @Special User, but mostly to thank people who's not just active and being helpful to the community.
The legendary role @Grass pretty much just proves that you touched grass IRL.

**Member Rewards**
- Members with @DART (and above) can access the #politics channel.
- Members with @SuperDART (and above) or @Server Booster role can access the #lounge channel. (such uncreative reward, right?)
@Server Booster members will also be on top of normal members on the members list.
